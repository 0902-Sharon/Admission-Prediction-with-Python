# Admission-Prediction-with-Python

A data analysis project for admission prediction on Jupyter notebook 
The scope of Machine Learning and AI is vast and it can be effectively
utilized for the prediction of Admission to different universities for post
graduate education using the concept of educational data mining.

In this project I have used Multiple Linear Regression
(MLR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) for the Admission
Prediction Model which will predict the chances of Admission into
Universities based on input data factors of GRE Score, TOEFL Score,
University Rating, Letter of Recommendation Strength, Undergraduate
GPA, whether the candidate has research experience or not.

These models are evaluated and tested for accurate and precise results
using evaluation metrics of MSE, RMSE and R2 Score, and the outcomes
of each ML model is compared.


Such prediction models are highly useful to students as well as
educational institutions which will save time and effort in the admission
and selection process and reduce the anxiety of students in choosing the
right university for their higher education.

Libraries Used:-
1. Pandas
2. NumPy
3. Sklearn
4. Matplotlib
5. Seaborn

Features of the Dataset:
1. GRE Scores (out of 340 )
2. TOEFL Scores (out of 120 )
3. University Rating (out of 5 )
4. Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength (out of 5 )
5. Undergraduate GPA (out of 10 )
6. Research Experience (either 0 or 1 )

Target Variable:
Chance of Admit = Probability value between 0.00 and 1.00
